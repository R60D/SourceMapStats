## Usage
* Launch the install.bat to get py dependencies
* Launch the Statistics_Write.py to gather in .csv format
* Launch the Statistics_Read.py to view the gathered information.
* Configure the desired map prefix. default is dr_
* Configure the desired game. default is tf
## Configure
You have to open the py files to configure them.
The parameters are at the top of the files so it should be easy to use them.



## Note
Currently the script is configure to scan TF2 servers with a specific map prefix. The Prefix can be changed, but changing the game might require more effort.
