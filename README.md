The data will be stored in a output.csv file by default in the same directory.
* Once you have a Output.csv with some data. You can view it with the Read.py file.
This will show you relevant information about the data you've just collected and generate a .png 

## Installation

* Open the Write.py to Configure the desired map prefix. default is dr_
* Open the Read.py to Configure the desired game. default is tf

## Debugging
